# Inspection Escalation Model
Overview: Inspection review is a time-intensive process and introduces human errors into any underwriting process. However, there is likely a limited universe of items within problematic inspections which would raise alarm. By utilizing natural language processing, it may be possible to take a PDF of an inspection, parse out its text, and cross-reference the inspection text with a list of pre-identified items of concern. If an item of concern is identified, it can be raised or escalated to a human underwriter who will deal with the item appropriately.
